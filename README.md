# CSS Portfolio Assignment

## Description
The purpose of this assignment is to apply our understanding of basic HTML, CSS and advanced CSS styling rules to create a responsive web page. This webpage also contains external links to completed projects and assignments, as well as our contact information. This project allowed me to demonstrate my ability to use CSS to create a webpage that is responsive and contains items that are arranged on the page using flexbox in CSS. I also completed this project by using proper semantics and syntax rules for CSS and HTML files.
